# PGN - Public Goods Network

PGN is both a digital schelling point and the world’s first L2 that works to create durable and recurring funding for public goods.

## We believe Public Goods are Good - and they should be funded

By definition, public goods are goods or services that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous in nature. Think, community parks, the air we breath, open source software, etc.

But the definition and understanding of public goods is evolving as new research, economic theories, and societal needs emerge.

We’re at a point where individual communities are choosing what constitutes a public good - and a vast array of definitions are emerging.

What’s yours? Get involved to secure the future of public goods.

## Public Goods, superpowered
